This is my submission for the Module 8 Lesson 1 Assignment!

This document is an upgrade to the original 'Cookie Recipe' HTML document, with added CSS styling elements such as background-color, margin, padding, font-family, border, button:hover, and more. 

There is also a link included to a submission form for alternate recipes, asking for input for a recipe name, ingredients needed, and instructions, all with a reset and submit button. 

Thank you!
